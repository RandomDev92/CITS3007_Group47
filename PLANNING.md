## IDEAS:

- Speed-running forum
    - Pros: Lots of Data to analyse
            Lots of categories to perfrom similar analysis in new contexts
    - Cons: Data is limited to times 
            No verification of times
            Limited amount of analysis types
- Competitive speed coding
    - Pros: Relevant and useful tool
            Variety in Types of data 
            Up our alley 
            with limited data we can have a variety
    - Cons: Some limited analysis
            We will need to make questions for data
            answers require robust judge website
            error outputs
- Forum with analytics
    - Pros: Lots of Data variety
            Lots of example websites to pull from
    - Cons: Hard to make enough data to fill the analysis 
            analsysis not very in depth or complicated
- RSID analysis tool
    - Pros: Useful tool
    - Cons: Limited types of analysis


## SpeedCoding
Decided topic, for interest and foreseable path 


### Application Requirements:

- Launch page
- User Page
    - Login/Signup
    - User Stats
    - Upload coding question (potential for verified and unverified questions?)
    - menu for uploaded questions and participated questions. 
- Select question menu - Search Page for questions?
- Question Page 
    - Some Considerations:
        - Should we let data stats be visible before attemps or just descriptoins and metadata like tags.
    - Accept Question feature regardless of if the user is able to complete the question or not.
    - after successful attempt-  
        - Coding question answer
        - review Question 5stars
    - Question Data
        - question reviews
         - View Your time completed
         - Average time of other users
         - Best time
         - Worst time?(probably not, for user motivation)
         - Total speedruns
- Question database (Unless we want them to store them locally, -we do not) 
    - What do we want to put in our questions metadata wise to describe the questions? Tags like: DP, Searching, pointer ect
- User database 
    - Hashing for login
    - Encryption
    - Secure Transfer
- Coding Environment for the user
    - Must be Secure!!!
    - Must look good on User End
- Community Aspect
    - comments
    - discussion board for question
    - site discussion board?
    - after completion discussion or review page?
-Admin Page "Low Priority"
    - uploaded questions could be offensive or wrong so being able to report them would be good and admin can delete it

### Comments
- Fanhua
    - I think the worst time isnt needed it wouldnt be too useful for the analysis
    - might need to add in a share results as a link
    - i also think the discussion board priority comes under the admin page for me.
