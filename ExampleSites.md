[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- The OG 
- Pros:
    - The design is very modern
    - Straight forward to use the Table for the problemset page is somewhat informative with acceptance rate and difficulty
- Cons:
    - The modern design might be hard with using our libraries and with our experience
    - I wish the problemset table would describe what type of problem it is in a broad sense since our website is timed, is it DP or a Grid problem?

    - All information is provided in the search table allowing users to pick questions to test specific skills

- so corprate

    - Simple and modern design, with a list of questions that have a short sentence desc and a difficulty
