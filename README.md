### Overview

**SpeedCode** is a Flask-based web application that helps users practice coding challenges in a timed environment, simulating competitive programming conditions.

With SpeedCode, users can:

- Attempt user-submitted coding problems in a LeetCode-style interface.
    
- Time themselves to track problem-solving speed and accuracy.
    
- View performance metrics like runtime, pass/fail status, and code efficiency.
    
- Submit their own questions to expand the problem bank.

- Share profile statistics with other specific users or shared publicly.

All user data, submissions, and profiles are securely stored and managed, ensuring a private and reliable experience.
